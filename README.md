Can we add cats to it?
imagine a small device attaching to cat collars as they roam freely. it will captures and transmits shortwave radio waves, contributing to the decentralized network of BunkerCoin.
By using the Recursive Possidon Hash Function and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), the device can autonomously identifies 'golden tickets' correlated with the miner's public key and coin holding duration. Cats mining coins while decentralizing the Bunkercoin network.
